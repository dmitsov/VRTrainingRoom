# VRTrainingRoom
This is a VR Training Room application developed for the Oculus Rift. Our goal is to develop an application for 
those VR Enthusiasts who find normal lectures... dull. We are 2 programmers who want to test ourselves and 
make something awesome(or at least something that would work OK :D)
